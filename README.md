# point cloud decoding
point-cloud based clusterless decoding (neural nets)

```
conda create -n point_cloud python=3.8
pip install -e.
```

current repo under development (need to get my old code together) :)

done: permutation-invariant neural nets

to do: 
- replace grid-like conv with graph conv layers
- hierarchical sampling
- deal with irregular spike sequence length (ragged array)
- how to model temporal pattern?
- multi-task learning
