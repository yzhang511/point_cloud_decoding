# clusterless_neural_nets
point-cloud based clusterless decoding based on neural nets

```
conda create -n point_cloud python=3.8
pip install -e.
```

done: permutation-invariant neural nets

to do: 
- replace grid-like conv with graph conv layers
- hierarchical sampling
- deal with irregular spike sequence length (ragged array)
- how to model temporal pattern?
- multi-task learning
